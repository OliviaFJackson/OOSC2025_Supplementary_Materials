**FILES and Descriptions**

| **Table_S1_CPUE_by_Gear_Gender.pdf** |

Summary: Gear-based differences in CPUE by gender and region.

Includes:
The median CPUE, mean CPUE, and number of trips for each combination of:
1. Gear type used (e.g., Nets, Lines, Hand-held spear, Speargun)
2. Gender of fishers (Men and Women)

- CPUE is expressed in kg per fisher per hour
- Only single-gender, single-gear trips with nonzero CPUE are included.
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-values are provided for each gear type in each region where ≥3 trips per gender were recorded.
- Gear types used only by one gender (e.g., Speargun used only by men) are still shown in the table with "–" indicating no data for the other gender.
- This table supports interpretation of gendered patterns in gear-based fishing productivity across both regions.

| **Table_S2_CPUE_by_Organism_Gear_Gender_DIANA.pdf** |

Summary: Diana region – CPUE by organism, gear, and gender.

Includes:
The median CPUE, mean CPUE, % CPUE, and number of trips for each combination of: 
1. Organisms Harvested (Fish, Octopus, Squid, Crab, Eel, Lobster, Shark)
2. Gear type used (e.g., Nets, Lines, Hand-held spear, Speargun)
3. Gender of fishers (Men and Women)

- CPUE is expressed in kg per fisher per hour.
- "% CPUE" indicates the percentage contribution of each gear-organism combination to that gender’s total CPUE for that organism.
- Only single-gender, single-gear trips with nonzero CPUE are included.
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-values are provided where there were ≥3 trips per gender for a given combination.
- This table helps interpret how gendered gear use contributes to harvest productivity for key organisms in Diana.

| **Table_S3_CPUE_by_Organism_Gear_Gender_SW.pdf** 

Summary: Atsimo-Andrefana region – CPUE by organism, gear, and gender.

Includes:
The median CPUE, mean CPUE, % CPUE, and number of trips for each combination of:
1. Target organism (Fish, Octopus, Squid, Crab, Sea cucumber, Shells, Lobster, Shrimp, Ray, Eel)
2. Gear type used (e.g., Nets, Lines, Hand-held spear, Speargun)
3. Gender of fishers (Men and Women)
4. 
- CPUE is expressed in kg per fisher per hour.
- "% CPUE" indicates the percentage contribution of each gear-organism combination to that gender’s total CPUE for that organism.
- Only single-gender, single-gear trips with nonzero CPUE are included.
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-values are provided where there were ≥3 trips per gender for a given combination.
- This table helps interpret how gendered gear use contributes to harvest productivity for key organisms in Atsimo-Andrefana.

| **Table_S4_Organism_Gender_Region_Summary.pdf** |

Summary: Percent CPUE contribution of each organism by gender and region.

Includes:
- The percentage contribution to total CPUE made by each organism for men and women.
- Each row represents the percent contribution of one organism to CPUE in a specific region, disaggregated by gender.
- Men and women are shown as separate columns under each region header.
- Only trips with CPUE > 0 are included.
- Values represent % of total CPUE per gender in that region, allowing direct comparisons of dominant taxa harvested by each gender.

| **Table_S5_Summary_Trip_Composition.pdf** | 

Summary: Summary of single-gender trip composition by region.

Includes:
- Total number and percentage of men-only and women-only fishing trips in each region.
- Total number of single-gender trips.
- Helps identify gender imbalance in fishing effort and reporting across Diana and Atsimo-Andrefana regions.
- Based on all fishing trips, including multi-gear trips.

| **Table_S6_Summary_Table_Supplementary.pdf** |

Summary: Key metrics describing gendered fishing patterns in each region.

This table summarizes key fishing metrics for single-gender trips in the Diana and Atsimo-Andrefana regions, disaggregated by gender (men vs. women). It includes:

- Total number of trips
- Mean fishing effort in hours per trip
- Mean and median catch per trip (in kg)
- Median CPUE (kg/fisher/hour)
- Percentage of trips using more than one gear
- Most commonly used gears (with % of trips)
- Most efficient gears based on median CPUE
- Mean number of different organisms harvested per trip
- Top organisms harvested, with their contribution to total CPUE shown in parentheses
- Only single-gender trips with valid fishing effort and catch data were included.
- This summary provides a snapshot of gendered fishing strategies and gear use across both regions.

| **Figure_S1_CPUE_Stacked_Bar_Plot.pdf** |

Summary: Stacked bar plot showing CPUE composition by organism, region, and gender.

Includes:
- Percent contribution of each organism to CPUE
- Separate bars for men and women in Diana and Atsimo-Andrefana
- Only CPUE > 0 trips included
- Visual comparison of harvest specialization across gender and region


**Note on Data Inclusion for Tables S2–S3**

Tables S2 and S3 include all single-gender, single-gear fishing trips with CPUE > 0, regardless of how frequently a given organism–gear combination was recorded. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests are reported only for combinations where ≥3 trips were recorded for each gender.

By contrast, Poster Figure 4 (stacked bar plot) displays only the most commonly harvested organisms—Fish, Octopus, Squid, Sea cucumber, Ray, Lobster, and Crab—to ensure visual clarity. This subset was selected based on overall importance and prevalence across the dataset. For example, although sharks were recorded in 6 trips in the South, this was not frequent enough to warrant inclusion in the figure.

Other figures (e.g., CPUE by gender or gear type) and all supplementary tables use the full set of valid trips, without filtering based on organism frequency or gear type count.


**Rationale for Filtering by Gender and Gear**

To isolate the effects of gender and gear type on CPUE, we restricted analyses to single-gender trips (i.e., trips with either only men or only women fishers). This avoids ambiguity in assigning catch to individual fishers and ensures comparability between groups. For figures evaluating gear efficiency regardless of organism, we included only single-gear trips, as multi-gear trips make it difficult to attribute catch effort or outcomes to a specific gear type. These filters enhance the interpretability and robustness of our comparisons.
