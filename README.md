| **Table_S1_CPUE_by_Gear_Gender.pdf** |

Description:
This table shows, for both Atsimo-Andrefana and Diana regions:

The median CPUE, mean CPUE, and number of trips for each combination of:

- Gear type used (e.g., Nets, Lines, Hand-held spear, Speargun)
- Gender of fishers (Men and Women)
- CPUE is expressed in kg per fisher per hour
- Only single-gender, single-gear trips with nonzero CPUE are included.
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-values are provided for each gear type in each region where ≥3 trips per gender were recorded.
- Gear types used only by one gender (e.g., Speargun used only by men) are still shown in the table with "–" indicating no data for the other gender.
- This table supports interpretation of gendered patterns in gear-based fishing productivity across both regions.

| **Table_S2_CPUE_by_Organism_Gear_Gender_DIANA.pdf** |

Description:
This table shows, for the Diana Region only:

The median CPUE, mean CPUE, % CPUE, and number of trips for each combination of:
- Target organism (Fish, Octopus, Squid, Crab)
- Gear type used (e.g., Nets, Lines, Hand-held spear, Speargun)
- Gender of fishers (Men and Women)
- CPUE is expressed in kg per fisher per hour.
- "% CPUE" indicates the percentage contribution of each gear-organism combination to that gender’s total CPUE for that organism.
- Only single-gender, single-gear trips with nonzero CPUE are included.
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-values are provided where there were ≥3 trips per gender for a given combination.
- This table helps interpret how gendered gear use contributes to harvest productivity for key organisms in Diana.

| **Table_S3_CPUE_by_Organism_Gear_Gender_SW.pdf** 

Description:
This table shows, for the Atsimo-Andrefana Region only:

The median CPUE, mean CPUE, % CPUE, and number of trips for each combination of:
- Target organism (Fish, Octopus, Squid, Crab, Sea cucumber, Shells, Lobster, Shrimp, Ray, Eel)
- Gear type used (e.g., Nets, Lines, Hand-held spear, Speargun)
- Gender of fishers (Men and Women)
- CPUE is expressed in kg per fisher per hour.
- "% CPUE" indicates the percentage contribution of each gear-organism combination to that gender’s total CPUE for that organism.
- Only single-gender, single-gear trips with nonzero CPUE are included.
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test p-values are provided where there were ≥3 trips per gender for a given combination.
- This table helps interpret how gendered gear use contributes to harvest productivity for key organisms in Atsimo-Andrefana.
